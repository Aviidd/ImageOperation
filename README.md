This is the Image Operation (Java) project I made myself.

Privacy is an important matter is the realm of the Internet. 

This project helps to protect the personal image / doc / pdf / ppt / word file from Others.

Like in day to day life we have all our data (bank details, card details, notes), we keep in our phone or laptop, if somehow the device remain unlocked by mistakenly, it can become a easy target for other persons to breach our privacy 

This project is simple, it will encrypt the file with the help of token no, and decrypt the file with the same token no, hence it strengthen the security of personal information
